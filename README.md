Using t-SNE for the visualisation and classification of quantum states.

Wigner_BellXX_Zeros.mp4 for X = [0,1] each give a video of a 3D plot of phi_1, theta_2, phi_2, varying through values of theta_1 for the zeros of the Wigner function for the Bell State for the corresponding qubits XX.

Wigner_BellXX_Full.mp4 for X = [0,1] gives a video of the 2D plot of theta_2 and phi_2, varying through values of theta_1 and phi_1 for the full Wigner function for the Bell state for the corresponding qubits XX.

cluster_pA_lrB.png for A = perplexity from [5, 30, 50, 100] and B = learning rate from [50, 200, 500, 1000] each show the results of applying the spherical t-SNE algorithm on the full Wigner function of the following states: Bell 00, Bell 01, Bell 10, Bell 11 (All shown in blue) and Spin uu, Spin ud, Spin du, Spin dd (All shown in red).
